1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,178
The last time we saw Philip,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,380
we learned about energy

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,880
and how it was converted.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,460
When he dropped the paint bucket.

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,172
Philip had to use energy to climb back

6
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:12,730
down the ladder and get new paint,

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,110
so he is not pushing the wheelbarrow

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,290
as fast as he did earlier,

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,621
even though he is doing the same

10
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,138
amount of work as before and thus

11
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:24,304
using the same amount of energy.

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,118
The rate he is working at is slower.

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,648
This means he has less power than before.

14
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,025
Power is the rate at which work is done.

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,662
We calculate it by dividing the work

16
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,336
done in joules by the time taken

17
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:41,544
in seconds to complete the work.

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,558
The unit of power is joules per second.

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,235
It is also known as the what.

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,029
W If Phillip took 20 seconds to move the

21
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:54,800
wheelbarrow and did 1000 joules of work,

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,650
his power is 50 watts.

23
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,426
Let's say Phillip takes one minute to carry

24
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:03,409
the 2K bucket up the five metre ladder.

25
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,278
What is his power?

26
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:08,080
First we calculate the work done.

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,740
Gravity exerts 10 Newton

28
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,815
per kilogram on the bucket,

29
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,554
so the weight of the bucket is 20 Newton.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,416
The work done is 100 joules.

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,759
We divide that by the time taken,

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,622
which is one minute in order

33
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,530
to find Phillips power.

34
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,910
But remember to measure power

35
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,814
you must use seconds,

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,205
so we convert the time

37
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:36,113
in minutes into seconds.

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,596
Therefore,

39
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,457
Phillips Power is 100 / 60,

40
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:42,319
so his power is 1.67 watts,

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,998
and that's how you measure power.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,736
You may have seen that electrical

43
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:51,898
objects also have what's written on them.

44
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,012
This is called the power rating

45
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:56,637
and it shows the rate at which

46
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,149
the machine does work.

47
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,955
Obviously this drill has more

48
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:02,147
power than Phillip did when he

49
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:04,049
carried the paint up the ladder,

50
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,540
and that's why we use machines

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,682
because they can exert more

52
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:11,094
power than what our bodies can.

53
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,728
Some machines are so powerful that

54
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:16,440
they are measured in horsepower.

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,710
1 horsepower is 750 watts.

56
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,422
The terms Watt and horsepower were

57
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:25,230
developed by Scottish engineer

58
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,966
James Watt in the 1700s.

59
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,594
He used the term to compare the power

60
00:02:30,594 --> 00:02:34,209
of horses with that of steam engines.

61
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,027
Looks like Phillip needs to find a new house.

62
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,590
At least he understands work,

63
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,838
energy and power though.
